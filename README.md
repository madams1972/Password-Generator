Purpose

This is an application that enables others to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The following explains the Password Generator application's functionality:

WHEN the user clicks the 'Generate Password' button to generate a password 
	
THEN they are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria 
	
WHEN prompted for password criteria 
	
THEN the user selects which criteria to include in the password 
	
WHEN the user is prompted for the length of the password 
	
THEN the user chooses a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters 
	
WHEN the user is asked for character types to include in the password 
	
THEN the user confirms whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters 
	
WHEN the user answers each prompt 
	
THEN the users input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected 
	
WHEN all prompts are answered THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria 
	
WHEN the password is generated THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
