Purpose
This week I to modified starter code to create an application that enables others to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The users password can include special characters.

WHEN the user clicks the button to generate a password THEN they are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria WHEN prompted for password criteria THEN the user selects which criteria to include in the password WHEN the user is prompted for the length of the password THEN the user chooses a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters WHEN the user is asked for character types to include in the password THEN the user confirms whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters WHEN the user answers each prompt THEN the users input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected WHEN all prompts are answered THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria WHEN the password is generated THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page


## Mock-Up
